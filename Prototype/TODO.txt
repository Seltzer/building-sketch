Symmetry:
	- Bias towards centre
	- Interpolate points if we don't have enough
	- Speed up neighbourhood search
	- Consider distribution across LOS axis
	- Introduce non-verticals to the candidate LOS set
	- Actually do something with the symmetry
	
	
Generate displacement map from features

Small features:
	- Cancel current line
	- Undo/redo
	- Fixing angles
	- Shift to draw straight line
